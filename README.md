1. Importance of Timely Delivery in Software Project Management & Ensuring Deadlines
Importance:
Prevents cost overruns.
Maintains client and stakeholder trust.
Ensures smooth software integration.
Reduce risk of outdated technology.
How to Ensure Deadlines are Met:

Set clear milestones and deadlines.
Use project management tools (e.g., Jira, Trello).
Monitor progress with regular updates.
Allocate resources effectively.

2. Effective Cost Control in Software Projects & Strategies to Prevent Budget Overruns
Importance:
Ensures financial stability.
Prevents project delays or failure.
Maximizes return on investment (ROI).
Strategies to Prevent Budget Overruns:
Define a clear budget and scope.
Track expenses regularly.
Use cost estimation techniques.

3. Agile vs. Waterfall Methodologies: Comparison
Advantages & Disadvantages:
Agile: Faster feedback, adaptable, but can be hard to manage for large teams.
Waterfall: Clear structure, well-documented, but lacks flexibility.

4. When to Use Agile vs. Waterfall (With Examples)
Agile is better for:
Projects requiring frequent updates (e.g., mobile apps, web applications).
Complex projects with uncertain requirements (e.g., AI software).

Waterfall is better for:
Large-scale projects with clear goals (e.g., banking systems).
Compliance-heavy projects (e.g., government software).
5. Quality Assurance in Software Projects & Importance of High Standards
Methods:
Continuous testing (unit, integration, system testing).
Code reviews and peer evaluations.
Automated testing tools.
User feedback loops.
Importance:
Reduces bugs and security risks.
Improves user satisfaction.
Saves time and money in the long run.

6. Defining Project Scope & Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
Importance of Scope Definition:
Prevents scope creep (uncontrolled expansion of project).
Helps in resource allocation.
Sets clear expectations.
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):
A hierarchical breakdown of tasks.
Helps in detailed project planning.

7. Benefits of a Detailed Project Schedule & Role of Gantt Charts
Benefits:
Keeps tasks organized and on track.
Improves team coordination.
Helps in risk management.
Gantt Charts:
Visual representation of tasks and deadlines.
Helps in tracking progress.
Ensures proper resource allocation.

8. Core Issues Addressed by the Software & Their Significance
Identifying Core Issues:
What problems does the target audience face?
How do existing solutions fail?

Significance:
Helps define the purpose of the software.
Ensures the software solves a real need.

9. Importance of Defining the Problem Clearly
Benefits:
Provides a clear development direction.
Helps in creating targeted solutions.
Reduces wasted effort and resources.

10. How to Describe Your Software Solution Simply
Focus on what it does, not how it works.
Example: "A smart app that helps farmers detect crop diseases easily."

11. Standout Features of Your Software
What makes it unique?
Faster, more efficient, or user-friendly?
Example: "Uses AI to analyze soil quality and suggest fertilizers."

12. Market Size & Growth Potential of Your Software
Identify the number of potential users.
Check market reports and trends.
Example: "The precision farming software market is growing at 12% annually."

13. How Market Trends Inform Software Development
Helps in feature prioritization.
Ensures competitiveness.
Example: "With more mobile users, we ensure our app is mobile-friendly."
